                        My name is Jan Werbrouck. <br>
                         I am 20 years old and live in Harelbeke, Belgium. <br>
                         I have been programming for a little over 2 years, studying Digital Arts and Entertainment - Game Development at Howest University. <br>
                         I really like programming and I’m always looking to learn more. So far I’m the most interested in engine and graphics programming. <br><br>
                         In my free time I like to play the guitar, play sports or meet up with friends.

                        Made with <b>DirectX11</b> and <b>C++</b> in the Overlord Engine,<br>
                        this game is an Endless runner, based on the famous game temple run. <br> 
                        The player runs on the ruins of an ancient temple in a beautiful forest, avoiding any obstacles on the jungle path! <br><br>
                        Challenges were the several graphical features in the game, like shadow mapping, post processing and instanced rendering, Because this was my first real DirectX project.

                        <b>Oh Crab</b> is a co-op couch game where each player controls a crab on the beach. <br> The goal? Build a sand castle and protect your pearl from both the waves and the other crab.
                        <br><br>This game was coded in <b>C#</b> in <b>Unity</b>. The biggest challenge was making sure the beach, the water and the crab reacted to each other in realistic and fun ways. It was made in a team of 5 people, of which 3 artists and 2 programmers. I was 1 of the programmers. <br><br>

                        Each player tries to expand their empire to reach the top of the map, by collecting and selling their resources in the most optimal way, depending on the prices of these resources on the market.

                        This fan project was written in <b>C++</b>, with <b>SDL</b> and <b>OpenGL</b>. <br><br>
                        It was the first game I programmed and I did almost everything myself: code, sounds, pixelart ... <br> 
                        The music and the universe of the witcher are of course not made by me :) <br><br>
                        While my programming skills have improved a lot since I made this, I am still very proud of this project.
