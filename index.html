                        this game is an Endless runner, based on the famous game temple run. <br> 
                        The player runs on the ruins of an ancient temple in a beautiful forest, avoiding any obstacles on the jungle path! <br><br>
                        Challenges were the several graphical features in the game, like shadow mapping, post processing and instanced rendering, Because this was my first real DirectX project.

                        <b>Oh Crab</b> is a co-op couch game where each player controls a crab on the beach. <br> The goal? Build a sand castle and protect your pearl from both the waves and the other crab.
                        <br><br>This game was coded in <b>C#</b> in <b>Unity</b>. The biggest challenge was making sure the beach, the water and the crab reacted to each other in realistic and fun ways. It was made in a team of 5 people, of which 3 artists and 2 programmers. I was 1 of the programmers. <br><br>

                        This fan project was written in <b>C++</b>, with <b>SDL</b> and <b>OpenGL</b>. <br><br>
                        It was the first game I programmed and I did almost everything myself: code, sounds, pixelart ... <br> The music and the universe of the witcher are ofcourse not made by me :) <br><br>
                        While my programming skills have improved a lot since I made this, I am still very proud of this project.
